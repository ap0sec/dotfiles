What is Internet slang? Do you know?

Internet slang is a collective term for abbreviations used on the Internet that mainly communicate with letters.

It includes emoticons and frank feelings of emotions.

That said, it will be hard to understand without specific examples.

So, let's take a look at some of the Internet slang in Japanese that is familiar to us

This is just one example of Japanese internet net slang.
I guess that some of you have people who have seen this.

The first example is "w"
This represents a laughing appearance.
It is often used by young people to communicate on SNS.

The next example is "ググる".
The meaning of this is "Search on google".
This is also frequently used in our daily lives.
Have you ever seen such a scene?

Hey you! Do not know how to solve this problem?
Umm\ldots{} ググれ

It's very useful.

The last example is "ポチる".
The meaning of this is "buying in the Internet Store".
